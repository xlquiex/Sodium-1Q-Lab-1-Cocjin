        Lilies are perennial plants known for their showy, often fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers. They typically grow from bulbs and have narrow leaves along a leafy stem. There are over 100 species of "true lilies" (Lilium genus), but the term "lily" is also used more broadly for other plants with similar flowers or foliage.
